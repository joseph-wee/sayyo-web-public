            Important Things to Know Before Deleting Your Account
            <br />
            Before proceeding with account deletion, please review the following
            information:
            <br />
            <br />
            1. Data Deletion:
            <br />
            Deleting your account will permanently erase all data associated
            with it (e.g., profile information, posts, messages, in-app purchase
            history).
            <br />
            Deleted data cannot be recovered. Please back up any important data
            before proceeding.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Login Information:
            <br />
            After account deletion, you will no longer be able to access the app
            using any login method, including Apple Login, Facebook Login, or
            Google Login.
            <br />
            Even if you re-register, your previous account data will not be
            restored.

            3. Confirm Login Method:
